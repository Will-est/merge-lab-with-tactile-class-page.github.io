Cutaway view of a finray gripper. There are empty air channels along the front and back sides of the gripper. Each front-back pair of channels connects to a differential pressure sensor.
**FORTE: Tactile Force and Slip Sensing on Compliant Fingers for Delicate Manipulation**<br><u>Siqi Shang</u>, Mingyo Seo, Yuke Zhu, <u>Lillian Chin</u><br>Under review at *IEEE RA-L*<br>[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18960) | [Website](http://localhost:1313/resources/student_project_websites/template/) <br><br>We create FORTE, 3D-printed finrays with internal force and slip sensing. By measuring the pressure change of embedded air channels at 2 kHz, FORTE can accurately estimate grasping forces from 0-8 N with an average error of 0.2 N, and detect slip events within 100 ms of occurring using an analytical model. FORTE grasps fragile objects like raspberries and potato chips with a 98.6% success rate, and achieves 93% accuracy in detecting slip events across 310 trials. <!--highlight -->

A robot that has a white 3D-printed wrist between the gripper and the rest of the arm. The wrist has a honeycomb structure.
**BiFlex: A Passive Bimodal Stiffness Flexible Wrist for Manipulation in Unstructured Environments**<br>Gu-Cheol Jeong, Stefano Dalla Gasperina, Ashish D. Deshpande, <u>Lillian Chin*</u>, Roberto Martín-Martín*<br>Accepted and in-press at *IEEE RA-L*<br>[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08706) | [Website](http://localhost:1313/resources/student_project_websites/template/) <br><br>We create BiFlex, a flexible 3D-printed wrist that uses buckling to passively switch from a high stiffness precision mode to a low stiffness compliant mode. BiFlex is easily generalizable to many robot end effectors while simplifying control.
